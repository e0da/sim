## Controller Support

Tested in Chrome and Firefox with the following controllers:

- Xbox 360 Wired Controller `Â©Microsoft Corporation Controller (STANDARD GAMEPAD Vendor: 045e Product: 028e)`
- iBuffalo Classic USB Gamepad (looks like SNES) `USB,2-axis 8-button gamepad (STANDARD GAMEPAD Vendor: 0583 Product: 2060)`

Both work with their default X and Y axes (left thumb stick and D-pad,
respectively), and both use the Xbox ABXY button layout. Xbox D-pad not
supported yet.
